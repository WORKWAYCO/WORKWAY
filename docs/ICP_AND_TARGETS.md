# Ideal Customer Profile & Target List

> **Goal**: Acquire first 10 paying customers by defining who needs WORKWAY most.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP: Integration Agencies

**Profile**:
- **Company Size**: 5-50 employees
- **Services**: Custom integrations, workflow automation, SaaS implementation consulting
- **Current Tools**: Zapier, Make, custom Node.js scripts
- **Pain Point**: Building the same workflows repeatedly for different clients
- **Budget**: $500-$2K/month for platforms that reduce client delivery time
- **Decision Maker**: Technical founder, CTO, VP Engineering

**Why They Buy**:
- Stop rebuilding the same workflows for every client
- Monetize internal tools by publishing to marketplace
- Private workflows let them deliver enterprise value faster
- Platform handles OAuth, hosting, scaling (they focus on business logic)

**Value Proposition**: Turn your client work into recurring revenue. Build once, sell many times.

### Secondary ICP: Technical Solopreneurs

**Profile**:
- **Role**: Independent developer, consultant, "technical founder"
- **Current State**: Building one-off automations for clients
- **Pain Point**: Trading time for money, no leverage
- **Budget**: $0-$500/month (highly price-sensitive)
- **Decision Maker**: Self

**Why They Buy**:
- Escape hourly billing by publishing workflows to marketplace
- Keep 100% of upfront revenue, WORKWAY only charges per-execution
- TypeScript feels native (vs. visual builders)

**Value Proposition**: Build workflows once, earn while you sleep.

### Tertiary ICP: Enterprise DevOps Teams

**Profile**:
- **Company Size**: 500+ employees
- **Department**: Platform Engineering, DevOps, Internal Tools
- **Pain Point**: SaaS sprawl, integration debt, tribal knowledge in Zapier accounts
- **Budget**: $5K-$50K/year for workflow infrastructure
- **Decision Maker**: VP Engineering, Director of Platform

**Why They Buy**:
- Code-based workflows fit existing DevOps culture (git, CI/CD, code review)
- Self-hosting option (important for regulated industries)
- Escape per-task pricing (Zapier bills explode at enterprise scale)

**Value Proposition**: Bring your integrations into your codebase. Own your automation.

## Messaging Framework

### For Agencies

**Subject**: Turn your client workflows into products

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I saw you're a [Zapier/Make/Notion] consultant. Quick question:

How many times have you built the same workflow for different clients?

WORKWAY lets you build workflows once (in TypeScript) and either:
1. Publish to our marketplace (earn from every install)
2. Use as private workflows for clients (deliver faster, charge more)

We handle OAuth, hosting, and scaling. You focus on business logic.

Interested in a 15-min demo?

Best,
Micah
```

### For Solopreneurs

**Subject**: Build workflows, earn per execution

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

You're trading time for money building automations.

What if you could build once and earn every time someone runs your workflow?

WORKWAY is a marketplace for TypeScript workflows:
- You keep 100% of upfront revenue
- We charge 5-25¢ per execution
- You earn while you sleep

Check it out: workway.co

Built anything cool lately?

Best,
Micah
```

### For Enterprise

**Subject**: Code-first workflow automation for [Company]

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Most workflow tools (Zapier, Make) force you into visual builders.

But your team thinks in code, git, and CI/CD.

WORKWAY brings workflows into your codebase:
- TypeScript-based (not visual builders)
- Self-hosting available (important for [healthcare/finance/etc.])
- Escape per-task pricing (flat rate or self-host)

Worth a 30-min conversation?

Best,
Micah
Founder, WORKWAY
```
