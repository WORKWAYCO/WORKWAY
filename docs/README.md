**Note**: Implementation plans live in `docs/` but are not part of the canonical documentation set. They represent point-in-time snapshots of specific projects.

## Documentation Principles

Following our Canon (Principle 10: As little as possible):

### 1. Single Entry Point
This file (`docs/README.md`) is the only starting point. No more scattered docs.

### 2. Clear Audience
Every document explicitly states who it's for: Developers, Investors, or Internal.

### 3. No Duplication
If two docs say the same thing, consolidate or delete one.

### 4. Outcome-Focused
Documents answer "What can I achieve?" not "What features exist?"

### 5. Living Documents
Update docs when code changes. Delete outdated docs immediately.

## Archive Policy

Implementation plans and historical audits are kept for reference but not actively maintained. If you're looking at a document dated before 2025-12-01, consider it historical context, not current strategy.

**Active docs**: Platform Thesis, Developer Capabilities, Architecture, Team Story, ICP & Targets, Investor Translation, OAuth Setup, Self Hosting, Workers Runtime Guide, Private Workflows, Agency Moat.

**Everything else**: Historical reference.
