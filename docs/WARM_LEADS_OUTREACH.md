## Personalized Email Templates

### Template A: Waitlist Signup

**Subject**: WORKWAY is live—your early access is ready

```
Hi [Name],

You signed up for WORKWAY [when they signed up]. The wait is over—we're live.

Here's your early access: workway.co

What you can do now:
- Build TypeScript workflows (no visual builders)
- Publish to the marketplace and earn per-execution
- Create private workflows for clients

What are you hoping to automate first? I'd love to help you ship your first workflow.

Best,
[Danny/Micah]
```

### Template B: Half Dozen Client

**Subject**: Built something from our work together

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick update from Half Dozen:

Remember the workflow automation challenges we solved for [their project]?

### Template C: LinkedIn Connection

**Subject**: [Name], quick question about your automation stack

```
Hi [Name],

We connected on LinkedIn a while back. I noticed you're working on [their role/company].

Quick question: How are you handling workflow automation? Still using Zapier/Make, or building custom?

We just launched WORKWAY—TypeScript workflows that run on Cloudflare's edge. Developers keep 100% of upfront revenue, we only charge per-execution.

Worth a 15-min chat if you're exploring alternatives?

Best,
[Danny/Micah]
```

### Template D: Twitter/X Automation Builder

**Subject**: Saw your [specific tweet]—this might help

```
Hi [Name],

I saw your tweet about [specific automation problem/project].

We built WORKWAY to solve exactly this: TypeScript workflows that run on Cloudflare's edge. No Zapier limits, no per-task pricing.

Example: [relevant workflow to their tweet]

Want to try it? I'll personally help you port your automation.

Best,
[Danny/Micah]
