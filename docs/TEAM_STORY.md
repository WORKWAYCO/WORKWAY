# Team & Founder Story

> **For investors**: Why this team is uniquely positioned to build WORKWAY.

## Founders

WORKWAY is built by the co-founders of **Half Dozen**, a systems optimization company serving the live events industry.

### Danny Morgan — Co-Founder, Growth

Danny leads business development and client relationships. His background in growth strategy and understanding enterprise pain points shapes WORKWAY's go-to-market approach. Danny ensures we build what customers actually need, not what technologists think they need.

### Micah Johnson — Co-Founder, Technology

Micah is a Systems Architect who spent years building integration workflows for enterprise clients. His day job is on Webflow's Marketplace team, designing developer experiences. What started as custom Zapier workflows evolved into bespoke TypeScript solutions when clients hit the limits of no-code tools.

**The insight**: Developers want workflows, but SaaS platforms force them into visual builders. Meanwhile, enterprises need compound workflows (meeting ends → Notion + Slack + Email + CRM) that no-code tools can't orchestrate.

WORKWAY emerged from this gap: A TypeScript-first workflow platform that lets developers build and monetize the integrations they're already building for clients.

## Company Structure

**Half Dozen** ("Systems, Simplified") is the parent company. We specialize in digital systems that optimize and streamline business operations through workflow automation and platform integration. WORKWAY is our product—the open-source marketplace for TypeScript workflows, running entirely on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure.

## Team Composition

### Current

- **Danny Morgan** (Co-Founder, Growth) - Business development, client relationships, GTM strategy
- **Micah Johnson** (Co-Founder, Technology) - Systems architecture, platform development, product design
- **Claude Opus 4.5** (AI Development Partner) - Autonomous code generation, architecture design

### Hiring Roadmap (Post-Seed)

**Q1 2026**:
- Developer Advocate (community building, SDK documentation)
- Backend Engineer (platform scalability, database optimization)

**Q2 2026**:
- Designer (marketplace UI/UX, workflow builder interface)
- Sales Lead (agency partnerships, enterprise deals)

**Principle**: Hire when revenue justifies it, not before. Bootstrap mentality.

## Why This Team?

### 1. Deep Domain Expertise

Through Half Dozen, Danny and Micah have built hundreds of custom integrations for clients in live events, healthcare, and fintech. They know:
- Where Zapier/Make break down (compound workflows, custom logic)
- What agencies charge ($5K-$50K per workflow)
- What developers actually want (TypeScript, not visual builders)
- How to translate technical capabilities into business value

### 2. Lean Execution Philosophy

WORKWAY was built with:
- Zero funding
- Cloudflare Workers (edge deployment, ~$0 cost at scale)
- AI-assisted development (Claude as co-developer)

**Result**: Production-ready platform with <$100/month operating costs.

### 3. Product-Market Fit Signal

Before launch:
- 50+ waitlist signups (organic, no paid marketing)
- 3 agencies actively testing private workflows
- 2 enterprise pilots scheduled (Fortune 500 healthcare, fintech)

**Evidence**: Developers want TypeScript workflows. Agencies want to monetize their work.

## YC Application Context

**YC invests in teams, not codebases.**

This team combines:
- **Complementary founders**: Danny (growth) + Micah (technology) = full-stack company
- **Domain expertise**: Years building the exact product we're selling through Half Dozen
- **Execution speed**: Production platform built in 6 months
- **Economic discipline**: Profitable unit economics before raising capital
- **Market timing**: AI makes workflow creation 10x cheaper, but SaaS platforms haven't adapted

## Narrative Arc

1. **Half Dozen Founded** (2022): Danny and Micah launch Half Dozen to build systems solutions for live events industry
2. **Problem Discovery** (2022-2023): Building custom Zapier workflows for clients, hitting limitations repeatedly
3. **Solution Hypothesis** (Early 2024): What if developers could build workflows in TypeScript and sell them?
4. **Technical Validation** (Mid 2024): Cloudflare Workers + TypeScript SDK proves feasible
5. **Market Validation** (Late 2024): Agencies want this. Enterprises need this. Waitlist grows organically.
6. **Now** (2025): Launch WORKWAY, acquire first 10 paying customers, apply to YC Summer 2026

## Investor FAQs

### Why TypeScript instead of visual builders?

**Honest answer**: Visual builders are great for simple automations. But compound workflows (orchestrating 4+ services with custom logic) hit a ceiling. Developers already build these in code for clients—we give them a platform to monetize that work.

### What's the moat?

**Honest answer**: Agency network effects. When agencies build private workflows for clients, they recognize patterns. Those patterns become marketplace workflows. The more agencies use WORKWAY, the more valuable the marketplace becomes. See [AGENCY_MOAT.md](AGENCY_MOAT.md) for the full strategic analysis.

### Why now?

**Honest answer**: AI drops workflow creation costs 10x (GPT-4/Claude can write workflow code), but legacy platforms (Zapier, Make) still charge per task. Edge computing (Cloudflare Workers) makes execution nearly free. The gap between creation cost and execution cost is the wedge.

### What's the risk?

**Honest answer**: Zapier/Make could add TypeScript support tomorrow. But they're SaaS companies—their revenue model depends on per-task pricing. WORKWAY's model (free for developers, usage-based for end users) aligns incentives differently. If they copy us, they cannibalize their own business.
