## How It Works

The extension syncs your Zoom session cookies every 6 hours while Chrome is running. This enables WORKWAY to access your meeting recordings and transcripts for the Meeting Intelligence workflow.

**Important:**
- Chrome must be running for auto-sync to work
- If you haven't opened Chrome in 24+ hours, click "Sync Now" manually
- If you log out of Zoom, you'll need to log back in and sync again

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Not logged in to Zoom" | Go to zoom.us and log in, then sync again |
| Extension not appearing | Make sure Developer mode is ON in chrome://extensions |
| Sync failed | Check your internet connection and try again |

## Security Note

This extension only accesses cookies from zoom.us and sends them securely to meetings.workway.co. It does not access any other websites or data.
